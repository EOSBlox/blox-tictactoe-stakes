## CONTRACT FOR TICTACTOE

### Intent
INTENT. The intention of the author and the invokers of this contract is to play the Tic Tac Toe in a two-player, winner-takes-all fashion with stakes. The game consists of a 3x3 board on which crosses and noughts (circles) are placed by each player in each round. A winner is found if three of the same type, i.e. three crosses or three noughts, are lined up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A draw occurs when no player has a winning configuration as described and there are no more moves left to make.

### Warranty
WARRANTY. The invoker of the contract shall uphold its Obligations under this Contract in a timely and workmanlike manner, using knowledge and recommendations for performing the services which meet generally acceptable standards set forth by EOSIO Blockchain Block Producers.

### Default
DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a material default under this Contract: 

### Remedies
REMEDIES. In addition to any and all other rights a party may have available according to law, if a party defaults by failing to substantially perform any provision, term or condition of this Contract, the other party may terminate the Contract by providing written notice to the defaulting party. This notice shall describe with sufficient detail the nature of the default. The party receiving such notice shall promptly be removed from being a Block Producer and this Contract shall be automatically terminated. 

### Force Majeure
FORCE MAJEURE. If performance of this Contract or any obligation under this Contract is prevented, restricted, or interfered with by causes beyond either party's reasonable control ("Force Majeure"), and if the party unable to carry out its obligations gives the other party prompt written notice of such event, then the obligations of the party invoking this provision shall be suspended to the extent necessary by such event. The term Force Majeure shall include, without limitation, acts of God, fire, explosion, vandalism, storm or other similar occurrence, orders or acts of military or civil authority, or by national emergencies, insurrections, riots, or wars, or strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages, or supplier failures. The excused party shall use reasonable efforts under the circumstances to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and shall proceed to perform with reasonable dispatch whenever such causes are removed or ceased. An act or omission shall be deemed within the reasonable control of a party if committed, omitted, or caused by such party, or its employees, officers, agents, or affiliates. 

### Dispute Resolution
DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Any controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to this Contract will be resolved by binding arbitration under the default rules set forth by the EOSIO Blockchain. The arbitrator's award will be final, and judgment may be entered upon it by any court having proper jurisdiction.

### Severability
SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Contract will be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable.

WAIVER OF CONTRACTUAL RIGHT. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Contract shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of that party's right to subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with every provision of this Contract. 

### Arbitrator's Fees to Prevailing Party
ARBITRATORâ€™S FEES TO PREVAILING PARTY. In any action arising hereunder or any separate action pertaining to the validity of this Agreement, both sides shall pay half the initial cost of arbitration, and the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable arbitrator's fees and costs.
